            The Google Assistant, despite the rather unimaginative name, is a powerful AI that’s available on just about every Android device on the market. Powered by Google’s powerful algorithms, this software is eerily intelligent.

            Moreover, Google has shown off some incredible AI features that will be part of Assistant in recent months. Including the ability to voice-dial people and make appointments on your behalf.

            One of GA’s biggest strengths is that it’s been more open than Siri for longer. So you’ll find it nicely integrated with services like Samsung SmartThings and Netflix. It’s also made its way to a wide range of devices, such as smart TVs, Google’s AI speakers and wearables.

            The Google Assistant is notable for its powerful language abilities, access to almost all Google services and wide interoperability with solutions from other companies. All attributes that somewhat put it in contrast to Apple’s Siri. The Google Assistant is also available on just about every platform in one form or another, so there’s nothing stopping you from giving it a whirl.
